Welcome to the **Random-Forest-Classification** project! This repository showcases how to build a Random Forest Classifier to predict music genres using audio feature data from Spotify. The model is trained on a curated subset of the `spotify_tracks.csv` dataset, focusing on popular genres such as pop, country, hip-hop, rock, Latin, EDM, and more.

## üìñ Project Overview

Music is a universal language, and with the rise of streaming platforms like Spotify, understanding music preferences has never been more critical. This project leverages machine learning to analyze audio features and classify songs into genres. 

The Random Forest Classifier is chosen for its robustness and effectiveness in handling complex datasets. This project provides a clear example of how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/O999-juice/Random-Forest-Classification.git
cd Random-Forest-Classification
```

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a subset of `spotify_tracks.csv`. This dataset contains various audio features that are crucial for genre classification, including:

- **Danceability**: How suitable a track is for dancing.
- **Energy**: A measure of intensity and activity.
- **Key**: The key the track is in.
- **Loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels.
- **Mode**: Modality of the track.
- **Speechiness**: The presence of spoken words in a track.
- **Acousticness**: A measure of whether the track is acoustic.
- **Instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.
- **Liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
- **Valence**: A measure of musical positiveness.

You can download the dataset from the official Spotify API or other music data sources.

## üß† Model Training

The Random Forest Classifier is trained using the audio features from the dataset. The training process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for training.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for classification.
3. **Model Training**: Training the Random Forest model on the selected features.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Code Example

Here‚Äôs a simple code snippet demonstrating the model training process:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('spotify_tracks.csv')

# Preprocess data
X = data[['danceability', 'energy', 'loudness', 'acousticness']]
y = data['genre']

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

## üìà Usage

After training the model, you can use it to predict the genre of new audio tracks. You will need to extract the same audio features used during training and pass them to the model for prediction.

### Example Prediction

```python
new_track_features = [[0.7, 0.8, -5.0, 0.2]]  # Example features
predicted_genre = model.predict(new_track_features)
print(f'The predicted genre is: {predicted_genre[0]}')
```

## üèÜ Results

The Random Forest Classifier demonstrates high accuracy in predicting music genres. The evaluation metrics show that the model performs well across various genres, making it a reliable tool for music classification.
